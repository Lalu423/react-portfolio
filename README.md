## Description
    This app is a portfolio for my recent work in full stack development. I have displayed my three most recent projects.
    There is an about me page, a contact page and soon to be a resume page. This app used react and exhibits my use of components. 

## Installation
    There is no installation required. This is a deployed app on a live site.  

## Usage
    The purpose of this app is for potential employers or collaborators in my quest to become a full stack developer.

## Contribution
    The mini-project in the react activity has been very useful. 
    My tutor Dennis Itua for this week was also very helpful in getting my site to be viewed in local host.  
    I also referenced a bool titled Learning React by Alex Banks. 

## Test
    There is no current Test function.

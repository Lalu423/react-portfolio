            <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Lalu. I have a degree in Digital Media Production. I have been working with
            various types of medium over the years. I started working with wedding videography and have worked hundreds 
            of weddings, it never gets old for me. I have also done graphic design work for a variety of local bands in 
            my area. I have designed flyers, T-shirts and album covers. I am always looking to expand my knowledge and 
            expertise in the visual world. I am currently enrolled in the UPenn coding bootcamp and looking to learn the language of HTML, CSS and
            Javascript. I am very excited for the experience because I know it will challenge me. I am looking forward
            to learn and see the things I can create with my new skill set.</p>
